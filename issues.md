To do list:
 * In `DEsiR-package.R` :
    * Check all the authors emails + affiliations. I've checked mine (and yours is alright as well I guess) but I don't which ones Sean and Andrew wants (also not sure how to do it but Sean needs he's flippidyfloping accent on his "e" as well).
    * Add reference
    * Add keywords
 * Get some functions examples!
 * Add an example data set
 * Unit test the functions!


Some problems:
 * It calls many functions from mulTree (yay!) but it's not a CRAN package. Therefore, there's no way to properly import them!
