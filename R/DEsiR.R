#' DEsiR: Estimating istopic fractionation / trophic enrichment factors
#' 
#' DEsiR uses a phylogenetic regression model to estimate the isotopic 
#' fractionation or trophic enrichment factor depending on ones preference for 
#' terminology. Estimates are imputed using Bayesian inference, and draw from 
#' species in close taxonomic proximity as well as including information on the 
#' tissue type and ecology of the desired estimate. The database used to
#' generate these predictions can be updated in the future as more infomraiton
#' becomes available, which will lead to ever more accurate and precise
#' estimates. Only mammals and birds are currently included in the pacakge, but
#' again this can be expanded to other taxonomic groups as more data becomes
#' available. We provide examples of how to use custom databases and custom
#' models for prediction.
